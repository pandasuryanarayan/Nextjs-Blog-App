# Next.js Blog Application

A simple, minimal blog application built with **Next.js** that allows users to view blog posts, each with a title, excerpt, and content. The app is designed with modern styling and includes dynamic pages for each blog post.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of blog posts with titles and excerpts. Each title links to the individual blog post page.
- **Dynamic Blog Post Page**: Displays full post content, including the title, content, and publication date.
- **Static Data**: Blog data is stored in a `posts.json` file and fetched using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for static generation.
- **Back Link**: Includes a back link to navigate from the blog post back to the home page.
